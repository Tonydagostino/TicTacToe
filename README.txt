PURPOSE
This tic-tac-toe program was written by Anthony D'Agostino
for a school project at Southern Connecticut State University. The program consists 
of an HTML file and a single Javascript file. Bootstrap is used to add some style 
to the page, and format the game's grid. Most of the HTML file was given to 
the class as a skeleton, with the game grid premade. My job was to write the javascript 
code from scratch to make the game run. This means the decision to use a table with id's 
for each cell to represent the game grid was predetermined before project start.

INSTALLATION
Just one HTML file and one Javascript file. Depending on your operating system,
you will most likely be able to click on tictactoe.html and the program will automatically 
open in your default browser.

USAGE
At the moment of submission the game is very basic. There is a large banner displaying the name
of the game, as well as which player's turn it is (X or O). Hovering your cursor over a cell
in the game grid will highlight that cell a shade of grey as long as the cursor is present within.
Depending on which player's turn it is, a click will fill the cell with either an 'X' or an 'O'
and the banner will change to reflect it is the other player's turn. Once a win is detected, the
banner will instead display which player won, and no more cells will be clickable. If all cells 
are filled and neither player wins, a draw will be declared instead. 
In order to play again, the page must be refreshed.

FUTURE WORK
-Implementation of a 'Play Again' button that clears all cells to reset the game.
-Code clean-up and optimization. This is my second web-page project ever, first one
with Javascript. I'm sure there is plenty of lines of code to cut down on!
